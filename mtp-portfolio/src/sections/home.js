                        As of 2024, I've had a very challenging but rewarding year as over the past 3 years,
                        I have studied and become a Computer Science Graduate at Royal Holloway, University of London.
                        In addition to a recent graduate, I'm also newly starting my career as a Junior Front-End Developer
                        whilst ultimately focusing on expanding my portfolio and greater develop my expertise in various
                        programming languages with dedication to deliver high-quality solutions.
